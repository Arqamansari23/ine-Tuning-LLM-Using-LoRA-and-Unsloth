# Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

The following cell installs essential libraries for fine-tuning.

**Unsloth** : A framework for efficient model management and fine-tuning.

**Xformers**: Optimizes attention mechanisms for handling large sequences.

**TRL** (Transformers Reinforcement Learning): Provides tools for reinforcement learning-based model tuning.

**PEFT** (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning): Reduces memory requirements during fine-tuning by updating only a subset of model parameters.

**BitsAndBytes**: Enables efficient quantization techniques, such as 4-bit precision.

Using these libraries ensures our environment is equipped for both memory-efficient and effective LLM fine-tuning.


# Step 2: Load Pretrained Model and Tokenizer

**What is Unsloth and What Is It Used For?**

Unsloth is a streamlined framework designed to simplify and optimize the process of working with large language models (LLMs). Think of it as your ultimate toolkit for fine-tuning and deploying LLMs with efficiency and ease.

**Why Did We Load the Model from Unsloth?**

We loaded the model from Unsloth because it provides a pre-configured, optimized environment tailored for efficient LLM fine-tuning and deployment. Here’s why this choice makes sense:

**Memory Efficiency:** Unsloth’s models are pre-quantized, often using techniques like 4-bit precision, which significantly reduces memory requirements without compromising performance.
**Long-Context Support:** The framework incorporates advanced features like RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) scaling, making it ideal for tasks requiring long input sequences.
**Fine-Tuning Ready:** Models from Unsloth are designed with parameter-efficient techniques in mind, ensuring smooth integration with LoRA and QLoRA.
**Ease of Use:** By handling complex setups internally, Unsloth eliminates the need for extensive manual configurations, saving time and reducing errors.
The model loaded here is "unsloth/llama-3-8b-bnb-4bit," a lightweight yet powerful variant for tasks requiring large language models.

#Step 3: Apply Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA)
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a more efficient form of instruction-based fine-tuning. Full LLM fine-tuning is resource-intensive, demanding considerable computational power, memory, and storage. PEFT addresses this by updating only a select set of parameters while keeping the rest frozen. This reduces the memory load during training and prevents the model from forgetting previously learned information. PEFT is particularly useful when fine-tuning for multiple tasks. Among the common techniques to achieve PEFT, LoRA and QLoRA are widely recognized for their effectiveness.

**What is LoRA?**

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a method that fine-tunes two smaller matrices instead of the entire weight matrix of a pre-trained LLM. These smaller matrices form a LoRA adapter, which is then applied to the original LLM. The fine-tuned adapter is much smaller in size compared to the original model, often only a small percentage of its size. During inference, this LoRA adapter is combined with the original LLM.

In our notebook, LoRA adapters are applied:

**Target Modules**: Defines which parts of the model are fine-tuned, like query, key, and value projections.
**LoRA Alpha & Dropout**: Control the adaptation strength and regularization.
**Gradient Checkpointing:** Reduces memory usage during training by recomputing intermediate states.
**Random State:** Ensures reproducibility.
This step ensure that wwe are only modifying specific parameters (around 10% of all parameters)

# Step 4: Load and Preprocess the Dataset for Fine-Tuning

**What is an LLM Dataset?**

An LLM dataset is a collection of text data used for training and fine-tuning language models. These datasets contain various types of text, such as questions, answers, documents, or dialogues, and are tailored for specific tasks or domains. The quality of the dataset significantly influences the model's performance and accuracy.

Types of Datasets for Fine-Tuning LLMs

Text Classification Datasets: These datasets help train models to categorize text into predefined categories like sentiment analysis, topic classification, or spam detection.

**Text Generation Datasets:** These consist of prompts and corresponding responses, useful for training models to generate contextually appropriate and coherent text.

**Summarization Datasets:** These datasets contain long documents paired with summaries, designed to train models to generate or refine summaries.

**Question-Answering Datasets:** These datasets include questions and their correct answers, often derived from FAQs, support dialogues, or knowledge bases.

**Mask Modeling Datasets:** These are used to train models with masked language modeling (MLM), where parts of the text are hidden, and the model predicts the missing words or tokens. This method is crucial in the pre-training phase for models like BERT.

**Instruction Fine-Tuning Datasets:** These datasets consist of instructions paired with expected responses, guiding the model to execute tasks based on user commands.

**Conversational Datasets:** These datasets are designed for training dialogue models, with conversations between users and systems or among multiple users.

**Named Entity Recognition (NER) Datasets:** These datasets teach models to identify and categorize entities like names, locations, dates, etc.

When we want to fine-tune a model for a specific use case, we can create a custom dataset that falls into any of the above categories. By curating a dataset that is tailored to the task at hand, we can optimize the model's performance to meet the specific needs of the application. This custom dataset allows us to focus on the relevant information and ensure that the model is fine-tuned with the most appropriate data for the target use case, leading to more accurate and effective results.


# Step 5: Configure the Training Parameters

Now let's define the training parameters, including the model, tokenizer, and dataset, along with key training settings like batch size, gradient accumulation steps, learning rate, and maximum training steps. The TrainingArguments specify additional configurations, such as optimization with the AdamW optimizer, weight decay, and logging frequency.

**Learning Rate:** Controls the speed at which the model updates during training.

**Batch Size:** The number of samples processed in one iteration.

**Epochs:** The number of times the model passes through the entire training dataset.

**Logging Directory:** Specifies where to store training logs, useful for monitoring progress.

The Trainer simplifies the configuration and management of the fine-tuning process, ensuring a balanced and efficient setup. We did 60 steps to make finetuning faster, but you can set num_train_epochs=1 for a full run, and turn off max_steps=None


# Step 6: Start Training

The line trainer_stats = trainer.train()initiates the fine-tuning process using the SFTTrainer. It triggers the training loop, where the model learns from the provided dataset based on the configurations defined earlier. we can see the loss is decreasing during training, this means the model is learning and improving its performance. In machine learning, loss represents how well the model's predictions match the actual target values. When the loss decreases over time, it indicates that the model is gradually adjusting its parameters to make more accurate predictions.

# Step 7: Perform Inference with the Fine-Tuned Model to Evaluate output

When we generate text with the fine-tuned model, the output typically includes the full structure of the input prompt along with the model's response. For instance, the output for this example looks like this:
